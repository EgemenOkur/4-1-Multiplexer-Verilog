# 4-1-Multiplexer-Verilog
Aim was to design a 4-1 Multiplexer with Verilog. 

What is a Multiplexer ?
Multiplexer is a combinational circuit that has maximum of 2n data inputs, ‘n’ selection lines and
single output line. One of these data inputs will be connected to the output based on the values of
selection lines.
Since there are ‘n’ selection lines, there will be 2n possible combinations of zeros and ones. So,
each combination will select only one data input. Multiplexer is also called as Mux.
Multiplexing means transmitting a large number of information units over a smaller number of
channels or lines.
